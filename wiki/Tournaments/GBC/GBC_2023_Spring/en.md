### Match procedures

1. A referee will create a multiplayer room 5 minutes before the scheduled match time. Players must join the lobby in that period.
   - The room settings are `Game mode: osu!mania`, `Team mode: Head-to-Head`, and `Score mode: ScoreV2`. The room name must follow the pattern of `GBC 2023 Spr`.
2. Possible mod choices for the FreeMod bracket are **No Fail, **Hidden**, **Fade In**, **Flashlight**, and **Mirror**.
3. The referees will select the beatmaps in order to play the match. If a player encounters a technical problem during a match, players may request a rematch from the referee after all the beatmaps have been selected.
   - "Lag spikes" will not be considered as a valid reason to rematch a beatmap.
   - The rematch should happen after completing scores for the other beatmaps in the mappool.
   - This rule should not to be abused. Referees may veto a rematch request if they find that this is the case.
4. Unless there are special reasons, the organiser will only record each player's first score of the beatmap in the match room.
5. The default rest time is **120 seconds**. If all players in the room agree to start early and get ready, the referee may start the match early.
6. Players are expected to keep the match running fluently and without delays. Excessive delays from the players' side may result in penalties being applied at the referee's discretion. Disrupting the match by foul play, insulting or provoking other players or staff, delaying the match, or other deliberate inappropriate misbehaviour are strictly prohibited, and will be punished accordingly.
7. All players and staff must be treated with respect. Instructions from referees and the host are to be followed. Decisions labelled as final are not to be objected.
8. The multiplayer chat rooms underlie the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules).
9. Disrupting the match by foul play or seed manipulation will result in disqualification, and any such players will be announced.
10. Unexpected incidents will be handled by the host. Referees may allow higher tolerance depending on the given circumstances. This is up to their discretion.
11. The host may request liveplays or recordings of individual players at any point.
12. The host reserves the right to modify these rules at any moment. Any such changes will be announced in advance.

### Mappool information

1. Each group has four mappools, and each group uses one mappool per round.
2. Each mappool consists of 7 beatmaps that will all be played under [FreeMod](/wiki/Game_modifier#freemod) conditions. This means that there is a unique FreeMod bracket.
3. The type of beatmap included in the mappool is not fixed.

1. Each stage of the tournament is played during **2 weeks**.
   - Group EX will play in the same week as Group S, and Group A in the same week as Group B.
2. All matches will be held between Saturday 08:00, and Sunday 23:59 (UTC+08), save for exceptional circumstances.
3. The organiser will provide alternative tournament slots before the start of matches each week, creating a schedule that is satisfactory to all players.

### Playoff stage

The rules are largely the same as in the regular season.

1. The organiser will invite some players from the EX group to participate in the playoffs.
2. There will be four separate mappools for each playoff round, with a varying number of beatmaps of different types.
   - Each mappool has one tiebreaker.
3. Players will have 2 minutes to pick and ban a beatmap, and 2 minutes to get ready. If a player takes more time than allowed, the procedures adopted will be as follows:
   - For map bans, the player forfeits the ban.
   - For map picks, a random map will be chosen from the mappool using `!roll X`, where `X` is the number of maps that were neither picked nor banned, excluding the tiebreaker.
   - For a ready timer, the referee will use `!mp start 10` command.
4. Each player will receive one *tactical timeout* of **2 minutes**, to be used as extra time to pick or ban a beatmap. The tactical timeout is optional.
   - The tactical timeout may be called on a tiebreaker, provided that all players agree to it.
5. A referee will create a multiplayer room 10 minutes before the scheduled match time. Players must join the lobby in that period.
   - The room settings are `Game mode: osu!mania`, `Team mode: Team Vs` and `Score mode: ScoreV2`. The room name must follow the pattern of `GBC 2023 Spr: ({Player A}) vs ({Player B})`.
6. Each player must use `!roll` once in `#multiplayer`.
   - The winner of the `!roll` chooses whether to pick first or ban first.
   - Each player may ban one beatmap from the mappool. These beatmaps cannot be picked by any player for the entire duration of the match.
   - Both players will alternate picking a beatmap from the mappool.
7. In the case of a tie, the beatmap will be rematched, but not more than twice.
8. Players are allowed to rematch if any player disconnects early on during a beatmap. Send a message as soon as poosible in the match room chat to notify the referee to restart the match.
   - The match may only be aborted before 30 seconds or 1/4 of the beatmap has elapsed, whichever comes first.
   - The same mods and beatmap must be used when the match restarts.
   - Please make sure to resolve any technical issues before restarting the match.
9. Unexpected incidents will be handled by the host. Referees may allow higher tolerance depending on the given circumstances. This is up to their discretion.
10. The host may request liveplays or recordings of individual players or teams at any point.
11. The host reserves the right to modify these rules at any moment. Any such changes will be announced in advance.
