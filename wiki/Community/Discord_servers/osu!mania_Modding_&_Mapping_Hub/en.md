**osu!mania Modding & Mapping Hub** is a community [Discord](https://discord.com) server designated for all current and aspiring [osu!mania](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!mania) mappers and modders. Users are able to find many channels that help them grow as a mapper, or interact with the general osu!mania mapping community.

- Channels to request mods, guest difficulties, nominations, or other mapping related requests.
- Channels where users can ask any mapping related questions, fit with experienced mappers to answer said questions.
- A place to share modding queues in order to gain more experience.
- A centralized place to find the status of [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Nominators).
- A list of useful references such as tools, RC proposals and other Discord servers.
